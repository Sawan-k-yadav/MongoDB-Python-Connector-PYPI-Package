## After Package deplyed on pypi
1. You can install with (pip install databaseautomation=0.0.2) whatever the latest version  
2. Need to use database_automation folder to import mongo_crud.py file
3. Now before creating client for which this package is made for, you need to define 
necessary variables like mongodb atlas uri, database name, collection name
4. For running the data creation pipeline of database automation, you need to pass list or dictionary
data with mongo_crud.py file.
```
Ex - mongo_crud.mongo_operation(data, colletion_name)
```

## read, delete, update with same package in progress.....

# requirements_dev.txt we use for the testing
It makes it easier to install and manage dependencies for development and testing, separate from the dependencies required for production.

# difference between requirements_dev.txt and requirements.txt

requirements.txt is used to specify the dependencies required to run the production code of a Python project, while requirements_dev.txt is used to specify the dependencies required for development and testing purposes.

# tox.ini
We use if for the testing in the python package testing against different version of the python 

## how tox works tox enviornment creation
1. Install depedencies and packages 
2. Run commands
3. Its a combination of the (virtualenvwrapper and makefile)
4. It creates a .tox
